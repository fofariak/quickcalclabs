      <h2>Understanding Puppy Development Stages</h2>
      <p>Puppies go through predictable developmental stages, each with specific physical, mental, and behavioral changes. Understanding these stages helps you provide age-appropriate training and set realistic expectations.</p>
      
      <p>This timeline helps you focus on the right skills at the right time—training that matches your puppy's developmental stage is more effective and less frustrating for both of you.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>🐕 Key Puppy Training Principles</h4>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <li>Keep training sessions short (5-10 minutes for young puppies)</li>
          <li>Use positive reinforcement—reward good behavior</li>
          <li>Be consistent with rules and commands</li>
          <li>Socialize extensively during the critical window (8-16 weeks)</li>
          <li>End sessions on a positive note</li>
          <li>Patience is essential—puppies are babies!</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>The Critical Socialization Period (8-16 Weeks)</h2>
      <p>This is the most important period in your puppy's life for behavioral development. Experiences during this window shape how your dog responds to the world forever.</p>

      <h3>What Is Socialization?</h3>
      <p>Socialization means exposing your puppy to a variety of people, animals, environments, sounds, and experiences in a positive way. The goal is to teach your puppy that the world is safe and interesting—not scary.</p>

      <h3>Socialization Checklist</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>People:</strong> Men, women, children, elderly, people in hats/uniforms, wheelchairs</li>
        <li><strong>Animals:</strong> Vaccinated dogs (after vet clearance), cats if applicable</li>
        <li><strong>Surfaces:</strong> Grass, concrete, tile, grates, stairs, wobble boards</li>
        <li><strong>Sounds:</strong> Traffic, thunder recordings, vacuum cleaners, doorbells</li>
        <li><strong>Environments:</strong> Car rides, pet stores, outdoor cafes, parks</li>
        <li><strong>Handling:</strong> Ears, paws, mouth, tail (for vet visits and grooming)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>⚠️ Socialization Safety</h4>
        <p>Until fully vaccinated, avoid areas with high dog traffic (dog parks, pet stores' floors). Carry your puppy or use puppy classes held on sanitized floors. The disease risk must be balanced with socialization needs—discuss with your vet.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>House Training (Potty Training)</h2>
      <p>House training typically takes 4-6 months with consistency, though some puppies take up to a year.</p>

      <h3>House Training Principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frequent trips outside:</strong> After waking, eating, playing, and every 1-2 hours</li>
        <li><strong>Reward immediately:</strong> Treat the moment they finish eliminating outside</li>
        <li><strong>Supervise constantly:</strong> Use tethering, crating, or baby gates when you can't watch</li>
        <li><strong>Clean accidents thoroughly:</strong> Use enzymatic cleaners to remove odor</li>
        <li><strong>Never punish accidents:</strong> It doesn't work and damages trust</li>
        <li><strong>Recognize signals:</strong> Sniffing, circling, heading to door</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Typical Schedule by Age</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>8-10 weeks:</strong> Can hold bladder ~1-2 hours when awake</li>
        <li><strong>12-16 weeks:</strong> Can hold ~3-4 hours</li>
        <li><strong>4-6 months:</strong> Can hold ~4-5 hours</li>
        <li><strong>6+ months:</strong> Can hold 6-8 hours (but shouldn't have to regularly)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Crate Training</h2>
      <p>A crate provides a safe den-like space, aids house training, and prevents destructive behavior when unsupervised.</p>

      <h3>Crate Training Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose right size (room to stand, turn, lie down—not too big)</li>
        <li>Make it cozy with bedding and safe chew toys</li>
        <li>Feed meals in crate with door open</li>
        <li>Gradually increase time with door closed</li>
        <li>Never use crate as punishment</li>
        <li>Build up to longer periods very gradually</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Essential Commands by Age</h2>

      <h3>8-12 Weeks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name recognition:</strong> Foundation for all training</li>
        <li><strong>Sit:</strong> Easy first command, useful for impulse control</li>
        <li><strong>Come:</strong> Start in low-distraction environments</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>12-16 Weeks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Down:</strong> More challenging than sit</li>
        <li><strong>Stay:</strong> Brief durations at first</li>
        <li><strong>Leave it:</strong> Important for safety</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4-6 Months</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Loose-leash walking:</strong> Critical skill for enjoyable walks</li>
        <li><strong>Wait:</strong> At doorways and before meals</li>
        <li><strong>Drop it:</strong> For trading objects safely</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6-12 Months</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Place/Go to bed:</strong> Calm settling behavior</li>
        <li><strong>Reliable recall:</strong> With increasing distractions</li>
        <li><strong>Polite greetings:</strong> No jumping on people</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Teenage Phase (6-18 Months)</h2>
      <p>Adolescent dogs often seem to "forget" their training. This is normal—their brains are reorganizing. Stay patient and consistent.</p>

      <h3>What to Expect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced responsiveness to commands</li>
        <li>Increased independence and "selective hearing"</li>
        <li>Fear periods (sudden fear of previously OK things)</li>
        <li>Increased energy and sometimes destructiveness</li>
        <li>Testing boundaries</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Handle It</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase management (leash, crate) when needed</li>
        <li>Go back to higher-value rewards</li>
        <li>Reduce difficulty of exercises temporarily</li>
        <li>Increase exercise and mental stimulation</li>
        <li>Be patient—this phase passes!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bite Inhibition</h2>
      <p>Puppies explore with their mouths, but learning bite inhibition is crucial. This means teaching them to have a "soft mouth."</p>

      <ul>
        <li>When puppy bites too hard, say "ouch" and briefly withdraw attention</li>
        <li>Redirect to appropriate chew toys</li>
        <li>Avoid rough play that encourages biting</li>
        <li>Puppy playdates help teach bite inhibition naturally</li>
        <li>Never use physical punishment for biting</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Preventing Common Behavior Problems</h2>
      
      <h3>Jumping</h3>
      <p>Don't reward jumping with attention. Turn away, wait for four feet on floor, then reward. Teach "sit" as default greeting behavior.</p>

      <h3>Chewing</h3>
      <p>Provide appropriate chew toys. Puppy-proof your space. Supervise until reliable. Chewing is normal—redirect, don't punish.</p>

      <h3>Barking</h3>
      <p>Identify cause (boredom, alert, demand). Address underlying need. Teach "quiet" command. Don't yell—it sounds like barking back!</p>

      <h3>Separation Anxiety Prevention</h3>
      <p>Practice short absences from early age. Don't make departures/arrivals dramatic. Crate training helps. Provide enrichment when alone.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Puppy Training</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>When should I start training my puppy?</summary>
      <p>Start the day you bring them home! Puppies can learn from 8 weeks old. Early training focuses on socialization, name recognition, and simple cues like "sit." Keep sessions short (5 minutes) and positive. The earlier you start, the easier training becomes.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How long does it take to house train a puppy?</summary>
      <p>Most puppies are reliably house trained by 4-6 months with consistent training. Some take up to a year. Key factors include: frequency of outdoor trips, supervision when inside, consistent schedule, and not punishing accidents. Smaller breeds often take longer than larger breeds.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Why does my puppy bite everything?</summary>
      <p>Puppies explore the world with their mouths and go through teething (which peaks around 4-5 months). This is completely normal. Redirect biting to appropriate toys, teach bite inhibition by withdrawing attention when bites are too hard, and ensure plenty of appropriate chew options.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Should I use a crate for my puppy?</summary>
      <p>Crate training is highly recommended. When done properly, dogs view crates as safe dens. Crates aid house training, prevent destructive behavior, keep puppies safe, and help with travel. Never use the crate as punishment, and don't crate for excessive periods.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>My teenage puppy seems to have forgotten all training. Is this normal?</summary>
      <p>Yes! The "teenage phase" (roughly 6-18 months) is when adolescent dogs test boundaries and seem to "forget" commands. Their brain is reorganizing. Stay patient, consistent, and increase rewards. Go back to basics if needed. This phase passes.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How important is socialization?</summary>
      <p>Extremely important. The critical socialization window (8-16 weeks) shapes your dog's behavior for life. Undersocialized dogs are more likely to develop fear and aggression problems. Expose puppies to varied people, animals, environments, and sounds—always positively.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Should I take my puppy to training classes?</summary>
      <p>Yes, puppy classes are highly recommended. They provide socialization with other puppies, teach you proper training techniques, and help prevent behavior problems. Look for positive reinforcement-based classes. Most accept puppies after first vaccinations (around 10-12 weeks).</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What training method should I use?</summary>
      <p>Use positive reinforcement (reward-based training). This means rewarding desired behaviors with treats, praise, or play. Punishment-based methods can cause fear, anxiety, and aggression. Modern science supports positive reinforcement as most effective and humane.</p>
