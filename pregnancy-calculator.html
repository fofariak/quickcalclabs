        <h2>How to Use the Pregnancy Calculator</h2>
        <p>Using our calculator is simple. Just enter the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP) into the date selector and click "Calculate My Due Date." The tool will instantly provide you with a wealth of information about your pregnancy timeline.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Your Pregnancy Timeline</h2>
        <p>A typical pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks (280 days) from the first day of your last period. This is known as the gestational age. It's important to note that pregnancy is counted from your LMP, not from the date of conception, which usually occurs about two weeks later.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Last Menstrual Period (LMP):</strong> The starting point for calculating your due date and pregnancy week.</li>
            <li><strong>Estimated Conception Date:</strong> This is approximately 14 days after your LMP, around the time of ovulation for a regular 28-day cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Fetal Age vs. Gestational Age:</strong> Gestational age (what this calculator shows) is about two weeks longer than the fetal age (the actual age of the baby since conception).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to Expect in Each Trimester</h3>
        <p>Your pregnancy is divided into three trimesters, each with unique developments and milestones.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First Trimester (Weeks 1-13):</strong> This is a period of rapid development. The baby's major organs and body systems form. For the mother, this trimester is often marked by symptoms like morning sickness, fatigue, and hormonal changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Second Trimester (Weeks 14-27):</strong> Often called the "golden period," as many early pregnancy symptoms subside. You may feel your baby's first movements (quickening), and your baby bump will become more noticeable. The baby continues to grow and mature.</li>
            <li><strong>Third Trimester (Weeks 28-40+):</strong> The final stretch! The baby gains weight rapidly, and their systems prepare for life outside the womb. For the mother, this period can bring physical discomforts as the baby gets bigger.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How is the Due Date Calculated?</h2>
        <p>This calculator uses <strong>Naegele‚Äôs rule</strong>, a standard method used by healthcare professionals worldwide. The rule works by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Taking the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP).</li>
            <li>Adding one year.</li>
            <li>Subtracting three months.</li>
            <li>Adding seven days.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This calculation is based on a regular 28-day menstrual cycle. If your cycles are significantly longer or shorter, your healthcare provider may adjust your due date after an ultrasound exam, which provides a more precise measurement of the baby's gestational age.</p>

        <div class="disclaimer-box">
          <strong>Medical Disclaimer:</strong> This calculator provides an estimate for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Your due date may be adjusted by your doctor based on ultrasound results. Please consult with a qualified healthcare provider for any health concerns or for personalized medical guidance throughout your pregnancy.

    <h2>‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq">
      <details>
        <summary>How accurate is a due date calculator?</summary>
        <p>‚úîÔ∏è An LMP-based calculator provides a reliable estimate and is a great starting point. However, only about 5% of babies are born on their exact due date. An early ultrasound is the most accurate way to determine the gestational age and confirm the due date.</p>
      </details>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <details>
        <summary>Can my due date change?</summary>
        <p>üìÖ Yes. Your doctor may adjust your due date based on the size of the baby measured during your first ultrasound, or if you have irregular periods. Once set after an early ultrasound, it typically does not change.</p>
      </details>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <details>
        <summary>What if I don't know the date of my last period?</summary>
        <p>ü§î If you're unsure about your LMP or have irregular cycles, the most accurate way to determine your due date is through an ultrasound performed by your healthcare provider. They can measure the baby to determine its gestational age.</p>
      </details>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <details>
        <summary>Is it possible to get a positive pregnancy test before a missed period?</summary>
        <p>‚ûï Yes. Some sensitive home pregnancy tests can detect the pregnancy hormone (hCG) in your urine several days before your expected period. For the most accurate result, it's best to wait until the day of your missed period.</p>
