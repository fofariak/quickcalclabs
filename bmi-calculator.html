        <h2>How to Use Our BMI Calculator</h2>
        <p>Getting your BMI result is easy. Follow these simple steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Select Your Units:</strong> Choose between 'Imperial' (pounds, feet, and inches) or 'Metric' (kilograms and centimeters) units using the buttons at the top of the calculator.</li>
            <li><strong>Enter Your Weight:</strong> Input your current weight in the corresponding field (lbs or kg).</li>
            <li><strong>Enter Your Height:</strong> For imperial, enter your height in feet and inches. For metric, enter your height in centimeters.</li>
            <li><strong>Calculate:</strong> Click the "Calculate My BMI" button to see your result instantly. Your BMI score, weight category, and a healthy weight range for your height will appear in the results box.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What is Body Mass Index (BMI)?</h2>
        <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value calculated from your weight and height. It's a widely used, simple screening tool to estimate how much body fat a person has. Developed by Adolphe Quetelet in the 19th century, it helps categorize individuals into weight groups that can indicate potential health risks.</p>
        <p>The formula for BMI is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Metric:</b> BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]¬≤</li>
            <li><b>Imperial:</b> BMI = 703 √ó weight (lbs) / [height (in)]¬≤</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Understanding Your BMI Results in Detail</h2>
        <p>Your BMI number places you in one of four main categories. Here‚Äôs what each one means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Underweight (BMI below 18.5):</b> This may indicate that you are not eating enough or could be a sign of an underlying illness. It's often associated with health risks like nutritional deficiencies, osteoporosis, and a weakened immune system.</li>
          <li><b>Normal or Healthy Weight (BMI 18.5 ‚Äì 24.9):</b> People in this range have the lowest risk of developing weight-related diseases. This is the target range for most adults.</li>
          <li><b>Overweight (BMI 25 ‚Äì 29.9):</b> Being overweight can increase your risk of developing health problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle changes are often recommended.</li>
          <li><b>Obese (BMI 30 or above):</b> Obesity is associated with a significantly higher risk of serious health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, certain types of cancer, and severe joint problems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Importance of Knowing Your BMI</h2>
        <p>While not a perfect measure, BMI is a valuable and accessible tool for a few key reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Health Risk Assessment:</strong> It provides a quick snapshot of potential health risks associated with your weight.</li>
            <li><strong>Starting Point for Health:</strong> Knowing your BMI can be the first step towards making positive changes in your diet and exercise habits.</li>
            <li><strong>Population-Level Data:</strong> Public health officials use BMI data to track weight trends across populations and develop health strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>‚ùóÔ∏è Key Limitations of BMI</h2>
        <p>It's crucial to understand that BMI is a screening tool, not a diagnostic one. It has several important limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>It Doesn't Distinguish Fat from Muscle:</strong> BMI can't tell the difference between fat and muscle. Since muscle is denser than fat, very muscular individuals (like athletes or bodybuilders) may have a high BMI and be classified as "overweight" or "obese" despite being in peak physical condition.</li>
            <li><strong>It Doesn't Consider Body Composition:</strong> It doesn't account for factors like bone density or the distribution of fat (e.g., visceral fat around the organs is more dangerous than subcutaneous fat).</li>
            <li><strong>Not Always Accurate for All Populations:</strong> BMI may not be equally accurate for different ethnic groups, genders, or age groups. For example, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for the same BMI.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>What is a healthy BMI range for most adults?</summary>
      <p>‚úîÔ∏è A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered the healthy weight range for most adults, as it is associated with the lowest risk of weight-related health problems.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Is BMI accurate for athletes and bodybuilders?</summary>
      <p>üèãÔ∏è Not always. Athletes often have significant muscle mass, which is dense and heavy. This can result in a high BMI that incorrectly categorizes them as overweight or obese, even if their body fat is very low.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can children and teenagers use this calculator?</summary>
      <p>üë∂ No, this calculator is designed for adults. BMI for children and teens is interpreted differently and uses age- and sex-specific percentile charts. You should consult a pediatrician for this purpose.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Does gender affect BMI interpretation?</summary>
        <p>‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è The BMI calculation formula is the same for men and women. However, body composition naturally differs between sexes‚Äîwomen typically have more body fat than men. While the categories are the same, a healthcare provider may interpret the results in the context of gender and other factors.</p>
