        <summary>How your blue light risk score is calculated</summary>
        <p>We build a 0–100 index from four normalized factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Total screen time:</strong> more overall hours raise eye‑strain risk.</li>
          <li><strong>Evening screen time:</strong> screens within 2 hours of bedtime strongly affect melatonin and sleep.</li>
          <li><strong>Brightness &amp; distance:</strong> high brightness and close viewing increase light reaching your eyes.</li>
          <li><strong>Protection habits:</strong> blue‑light filters and regular breaks lower the score.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each factor is mapped to a sub‑score (0–100, higher = more risk) and combined with an evidence‑informed weighting model where <strong>evening exposure and brightness/distance carry extra influence</strong>. This index is educational—eye health and sleep issues should be discussed with your eye‑care or medical professional.</p>

      <h2>Why Blue Light Exposure Matters</h2>
      <p>Digital screens emit high-energy visible (HEV) blue light with wavelengths between 400-495 nanometers. While blue light exposure during the day helps regulate your circadian rhythm and keeps you alert, excessive exposure—especially in the evening—can have significant effects on both your eyes and your sleep.</p>
      
      <p>This calculator evaluates your screen time patterns, brightness levels, viewing distance, and protective habits to estimate your risk for digital eye strain and sleep disruption. Understanding your blue light exposure helps you make informed decisions about screen habits.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>👁️ The 20-20-20 Rule</h4>
        <p>Every <strong>20 minutes</strong>, look at something <strong>20 feet away</strong> for at least <strong>20 seconds</strong>. This simple practice reduces eye strain by allowing your eye muscles to relax and your blink rate to normalize. Set a timer to remind yourself!</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Understanding Digital Eye Strain</h2>
      <p>Digital eye strain (also called computer vision syndrome) affects 50-90% of people who work at screens. Symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eye fatigue and discomfort:</strong> Eyes feel tired, heavy, or sore</li>
        <li><strong>Dry, irritated eyes:</strong> Staring at screens reduces blink rate by up to 66%</li>
        <li><strong>Blurred vision:</strong> Difficulty focusing, especially after long screen sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Headaches:</strong> Often felt in the forehead or around the eyes</li>
        <li><strong>Neck and shoulder pain:</strong> From poor posture while using devices</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty concentrating:</strong> Mental fatigue from prolonged screen work</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Blue Light and Sleep Disruption</h2>
      <p>The most significant impact of evening blue light exposure is on your sleep. Here's how it works:</p>
      
      <h3>The Melatonin Connection</h3>
      <p>Your body produces <strong>melatonin</strong>, the "sleep hormone," when it senses darkness. Blue light in the 460-480 nm range is particularly effective at suppressing melatonin production because it signals "daytime" to your brain. Even small amounts of blue light in the 2 hours before bed can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delay melatonin release by 1-3 hours</li>
        <li>Reduce total melatonin production</li>
        <li>Push back your internal sleep clock (circadian rhythm)</li>
        <li>Decrease REM sleep quality</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Evening Screen Problem</h3>
      <p>Research shows that just 2 hours of tablet use before bed can suppress melatonin by 22%. Using a phone in bed with the screen close to your face can be even more impactful. This is why evening screen time is weighted heavily in our calculator—it's the single most important factor for sleep quality.</p>

      <h2>Factors That Increase Blue Light Risk</h2>
      <p>Our calculator evaluates four key factors that influence your blue light exposure and its effects:</p>

      <h3>1. Total Screen Time</h3>
      <p>More hours in front of screens means more cumulative light exposure and more time for eye strain to develop. While there's no magic "safe" number, most eye specialists recommend limiting recreational screen time and taking frequent breaks during work use.</p>

      <h3>2. Evening / Pre-Bed Screen Use</h3>
      <p>Screen use in the 2-3 hours before bedtime has outsized effects on sleep. The closer to bedtime, the more disruptive. Using screens in bed with the room dark is particularly problematic—the contrast makes the light more impactful.</p>

      <h3>3. Brightness and Distance</h3>
      <p>Brighter screens and closer viewing distances increase the intensity of light reaching your retinas. High brightness in a dark room is especially straining. Viewing distance matters too—phones held close to your face deliver more concentrated light than a TV across the room.</p>

      <h3>4. Protective Habits</h3>
      <p>Blue light filters (night mode), regular breaks, and proper screen positioning can significantly reduce your risk. These habits don't eliminate blue light exposure but can reduce its impact substantially.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>📱 Simple Ways to Protect Your Eyes and Sleep</h4>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <li>Follow the <strong>20-20-20 rule</strong> during work hours</li>
          <li>Keep screens at <strong>arm's length</strong> and slightly below eye level</li>
          <li>Enable <strong>night mode / warm filters</strong> after sunset</li>
          <li>Match screen brightness to your environment (dim in dark rooms)</li>
          <li>Create a <strong>screen-free wind-down</strong> for 60-90 minutes before bed</li>
          <li>Use reading mode or e-ink devices for evening reading</li>
          <li>Keep phones and tablets out of the bedroom</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Blue Light Blocking Strategies</h2>
      <p>Several strategies can reduce blue light exposure and its effects:</p>

      <h3>Software Filters (Night Mode)</h3>
      <p>Built-in features like Night Shift (iOS), Night Light (Windows), and f.lux shift screen colors toward warmer tones in the evening, reducing blue light emission. These are free, effective, and should be enabled on all your devices.</p>

      <h3>Blue Light Glasses</h3>
      <p>Blue-blocking glasses filter some blue light before it reaches your eyes. Research shows mixed results—they may help some people but aren't a substitute for good screen habits. They're most useful for people who can't reduce evening screen time.</p>

      <h3>Screen Protectors</h3>
      <p>Blue light filtering screen protectors can reduce blue light emission from specific devices. Quality varies significantly by brand and product.</p>

      <h3>Environmental Adjustments</h3>
      <p>Proper room lighting (avoid using screens in complete darkness), larger text sizes (to increase viewing distance), and monitor positioning all contribute to reduced strain.</p>

      <h2>Special Considerations for Children</h2>
      <p>Children's eyes are particularly susceptible to blue light effects because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Their pupils are larger, allowing more light through</li>
        <li>Their lenses are more transparent, filtering less blue light</li>
        <li>They tend to hold devices closer to their faces</li>
        <li>Their circadian rhythms are more sensitive to light disruption</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting screen time for children and especially avoiding screens in the hour before bedtime.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Blue Light</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Does blue light from screens cause permanent eye damage?</summary>
      <p>Current research mainly links screen blue light to <strong>eye strain and sleep disruption</strong>, not to permanent retinal damage at typical use levels. Some lab studies show blue light can damage retinal cells, but these use much higher intensities than screens emit. However, the long-term effects of decades of heavy screen use are not yet fully understood, so good screen hygiene remains important.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How much evening screen time is too much?</summary>
      <p>Using bright screens in the last 1-2 hours before bed can significantly delay melatonin release and make it harder to fall asleep. Most sleep experts recommend keeping screens dim, using warm filters, or avoiding them altogether in that window. The closer to bedtime and the brighter the screen, the more disruptive the effect.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do blue light blocking glasses actually work?</summary>
      <p>Blue-blocking glasses may reduce some blue light reaching your eyes and might help some people with eye strain or sleep. However, research shows mixed results, and they don't fix underlying issues like excessive screen time, close viewing, or lack of breaks. Think of them as one tool alongside good screen hygiene, not a magic solution.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Is all blue light bad for you?</summary>
      <p>No. Blue light during the day is actually beneficial—it helps regulate your circadian rhythm, boosts alertness, and improves mood. The issue is specifically excessive blue light in the evening, which interferes with natural melatonin production and sleep timing. Morning blue light exposure (including natural sunlight) is good for you.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Does dark mode help reduce blue light?</summary>
      <p>Dark mode reduces overall screen brightness, which can reduce eye strain and total light exposure. However, it doesn't specifically reduce the blue wavelengths—you'll still want night mode/warm filter features for that. Dark mode is most helpful for reducing strain in low-light environments.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Are e-readers better than tablets for evening reading?</summary>
      <p>E-ink devices (like Kindle Paperwhite) emit much less light than tablets and phones, making them a better choice for evening reading. Front-lit e-readers with warm light settings are especially good. However, backlit tablets and phones with warm filters enabled and low brightness are a reasonable alternative.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How does blue light affect children differently?</summary>
      <p>Children's eyes let in more blue light than adults' (larger pupils, more transparent lenses), and their circadian rhythms are more sensitive to disruption. This makes limiting evening screen time especially important for children. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding screens in the hour before bedtime for all children.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can blue light cause headaches?</summary>
      <p>Blue light itself may not directly cause headaches, but digital eye strain from prolonged screen use often does. Eye muscle fatigue, reduced blinking, poor posture, and screen glare all contribute to screen-related headaches. Following the 20-20-20 rule and proper screen positioning can help.</p>
