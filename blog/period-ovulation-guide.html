    <p>The menstrual cycle is a vital sign of health and a complex, powerful process. Understanding its rhythm can empower you, whether you're trying to conceive, avoiding pregnancy, or simply want to be more in tune with your body. This guide will break down the phases of your cycle, explain how to identify your most fertile days, and show you how to predict ovulation with confidence. Let's start by mapping out your personal cycle.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>The Four Phases of the Menstrual Cycle</h2>
    <p>A typical menstrual cycle lasts between 21 and 35 days, with the average being 28 days. It is governed by hormonal fluctuations and can be divided into four main phases:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Menstrual Phase (The Period):</strong> This is day 1 of your cycle. The uterine lining (endometrium) is shed, resulting in bleeding that typically lasts 3 to 7 days.</li>
      <li><strong>Follicular Phase:</strong> This phase starts on day 1 and overlaps with your period, continuing until ovulation. The pituitary gland releases Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), which prompts the ovaries to prepare an egg for release.</li>
      <li><strong>Ovulation Phase:</strong> A surge in Luteinizing Hormone (LH) triggers the ovary to release a mature egg. This is the peak of your fertility. The egg is viable for about 12-24 hours after release.</li>
      <li><strong>Luteal Phase:</strong> After ovulation, the follicle that released the egg transforms into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. This hormone thickens the uterine lining to prepare for a potential pregnancy. If fertilization doesn't occur, hormone levels drop, and the cycle begins again with menstruation.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Identifying Your Fertile Window</h2>
    <p>Your "fertile window" is the time in your cycle when you are most likely to get pregnant. It includes the five days leading up to ovulation and the day of ovulation itself. Sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract for up to five days, so intercourse during this window gives the highest chance of conception.</p>

    <p>Our Period & Ovulation Calculator helps you estimate this window by using two key pieces of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The first day of your last period:</strong> This establishes the starting point of your current cycle.</li>
      <li><strong>Your average cycle length:</strong> This allows the calculator to predict the timeline of future cycles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While calculators are a fantastic starting point, you can confirm your fertile window by tracking physical signs like changes in cervical mucus and using ovulation predictor kits.</p>

    <h2>Affiliate Corner: Tools for Fertility and Cycle Tracking</h2>

  <section class="faq-section">
    <h2>‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>How accurate are ovulation calculators?</summary>
      <p>They provide a reliable estimate, especially for women with regular cycles. However, they are predictions. Factors like stress, illness, or travel can alter your cycle length and ovulation day. For maximum accuracy, combine calculator predictions with physical tracking methods.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can I get pregnant right after my period?</summary>
      <p>It's less likely, but possible, especially for women with shorter cycles. If you have a 21-day cycle, your fertile window could begin as early as day 6 or 7, which might overlap with the end of your period. This is why tracking is so important.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Should this calculator be used for contraception?</summary>
      <p>No. The fertility awareness method requires diligent tracking of multiple signs (BBT, cervical mucus, etc.) and has a higher failure rate than other forms of birth control. Our calculator should not be used as your sole method of contraception.</p>
