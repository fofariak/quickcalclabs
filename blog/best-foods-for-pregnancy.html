    <h2>Key Nutrients for Pregnancy and Where to Find Them</h2>
    <p>During pregnancy, your need for certain nutrients increases significantly. Here are some of the most important ones and the best food sources:</p>

    <h3>1. Folate (Folic Acid)</h3>
    <p><strong>Why it's important:</strong> Crucial for preventing neural tube defects, which are serious abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord.
    <strong>Best food sources:</strong> Lentils, beans, asparagus, leafy green vegetables (like spinach and kale), and fortified cereals.</p>

    <h3>2. Iron</h3>
    <p><strong>Why it's important:</strong> Your body uses iron to make extra blood (hemoglobin) for you and your baby. It also helps move oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your bodyâ€”and to your baby's.
    <strong>Best food sources:</strong> Lean red meat, poultry, fish, beans, and iron-fortified cereals. To improve absorption, pair iron-rich foods with a source of vitamin C, like oranges or bell peppers.</p>

    <h3>3. Calcium</h3>
    <p><strong>Why it's important:</strong> Calcium helps build your baby's bones and teeth. If you don't get enough, your body will take it from your own bones.
    <strong>Best food sources:</strong> Dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese), fortified plant-based milks, sardines, and dark leafy greens.</p>
    

    <h3>4. Protein</h3>
    <p><strong>Why it's important:</strong> Protein is a critical building block for your baby's cells, tissues, and organs.
    <strong>Best food sources:</strong> Lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, nuts, and tofu.</p>

    <h3>5. DHA (an Omega-3 Fatty Acid)</h3>
    <p><strong>Why it's important:</strong> Essential for your baby's brain and eye development.
    <strong>Best food sources:</strong> Low-mercury fatty fish like salmon, sardines, and anchovies. If you don't eat fish, consider a prenatal vitamin with DHA.</p>

    <h2>Top 5 Superfoods for Pregnancy</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> They are a fantastic source of high-quality protein and choline, which is vital for brain development.</li>
      <li><strong>Salmon:</strong> Packed with protein and DHA omega-3s. Just be sure to stick to 2-3 servings of low-mercury fish per week.</li>
      <li><strong>Sweet Potatoes:</strong> Rich in beta-carotene, which your body converts to Vitamin A, essential for your baby's development. They are also a great source of fiber.</li>
      <li><strong>Greek Yogurt:</strong> A calcium and protein powerhouse. It also contains probiotics, which are beneficial for gut health.</li>
      <li><strong>Legumes (Lentils, Beans, Chickpeas):</strong> An excellent plant-based source of protein, fiber, iron, and folate.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Foods and Drinks to Limit or Avoid</h2>
    <p>It's also important to know what to avoid. Steer clear of high-mercury fish, raw or undercooked meat and eggs, unpasteurized dairy products, deli meats, and alcohol.</p>
