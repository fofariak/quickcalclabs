    <p>Congratulations on your pregnancy! This incredible journey is a time of profound change and growth, not just for your baby, but for you as well. One of the most powerful ways you can support this process is through nutrition. The concept of "eating for two" isn't about eating twice as much, but about eating twice as smart. The foods you choose provide the essential building blocks for your baby's brain, bones, and organs, while also supporting your own health, energy, and well-being.</p>
    <p>Navigating pregnancy nutrition doesn't have to be complicated or stressful. The focus should be on incorporating a variety of whole, nutrient-dense foods into your diet. This guide will walk you through the most important nutrients, the superfoods that pack a punch, and what to be mindful of to ensure a healthy and happy nine months. To help you with your planning, start by finding out your estimated due date with our calculator!</p>

    <h2 id="key-nutrients">Key Nutrients for a Healthy Pregnancy</h2>
    <p>During pregnancy, your requirements for certain micronutrients increase significantly to support the rapid growth of your baby and changes in your own body. While a balanced diet is the best source, a high-quality prenatal vitamin is essential to fill any gaps. Here are the powerhouse nutrients to prioritize:</p>

            <td>Essential for preventing neural tube defects (serious abnormalities of the brain and spine) in the early weeks of pregnancy.</td>
            <td>600 mcg</td>
            <td>Lentils, beans, asparagus, spinach, kale, avocado, fortified cereals.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Iron</strong></td>
            <td>Needed to make extra blood (hemoglobin) to supply oxygen to the baby. Prevents anemia, which can cause fatigue and complications.</td>
            <td>27 mg</td>
            <td>Lean red meat, poultry, fish, lentils, spinach, tofu, iron-fortified cereals.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Calcium</strong></td>
            <td>Builds your babyâ€™s bones and teeth. If intake is insufficient, the baby will draw calcium from your own bones.</td>
            <td>1,000 mg</td>
            <td>Yogurt, milk, cheese, sardines, fortified plant milks, tofu, kale.</td>
          </tr>
           <tr>
            <td><strong>Protein</strong></td>

           <tr>
            <td><strong>Choline</strong></td>

    </div>
     <div class="info-box">
      <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: Boost Your Iron Absorption!</strong> To get the most out of plant-based iron sources (non-heme iron), pair them with a food rich in Vitamin C. For example, squeeze lemon juice over your spinach salad, have a side of bell peppers with your lentils, or drink a small glass of orange juice with your fortified cereal.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="superfoods">Top 5 Pregnancy Superfoods</h2>
    <p>While a varied diet is key, some foods are particularly packed with the nutrients you and your baby need most. Try to incorporate these powerhouses into your weekly routine:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Eggs</h3>
    <p>Eggs are nutritional gold. A single large egg provides about 6 grams of high-quality protein and is one of the best food sources of choline, a superstar nutrient for your baby's brain development. They are quick to prepare, versatile, and affordable, making them an easy addition to any meal.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Salmon</h3>
    <p>Fatty fish like salmon are loaded with two of the most important nutrients for pregnancy: high-quality protein and DHA omega-3 fatty acids. DHA is critical for your baby's brain and eye development. Aim for 2-3 servings (about 8-12 ounces) of low-mercury fish per week. Canned light tuna, sardines, and anchovies are also great choices.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Legumes (Lentils, Beans, Chickpeas)</h3>
    <p>This group of plants is an incredible source of fiber, protein, iron, and folate. Fiber can help combat the common pregnancy issue of constipation, while iron and folate are essential for blood and cell production. They are a fantastic, budget-friendly way to bulk up soups, salads, and stews.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Greek Yogurt</h3>
    <p>Plain Greek yogurt typically contains twice the protein of regular yogurt and is an excellent source of calcium. Calcium is vital for keeping your own bones strong while helping your baby build a healthy skeleton. It also provides probiotics, beneficial bacteria that support gut health for both you and your baby.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Sweet Potatoes</h3>
    <p>These vibrant tubers are rich in beta-carotene, a plant compound that your body converts into Vitamin A. Vitamin A is essential for the development of your baby's eyes, bones, and skin. Sweet potatoes are also a great source of fiber, which aids digestion and helps stabilize blood sugar.</p>

    <h2 id="meal-plan">Sample One-Day Pregnancy Meal Plan</h2>
    <p>Hereâ€™s what a day of nutrient-dense eating could look like. Remember to drink plenty of water throughout the day!</p>
    <div class="info-box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Scrambled eggs (2) with spinach and a side of whole-wheat toast with avocado.</li>
        <li><strong>Morning Snack:</strong> A bowl of Greek yogurt with a handful of berries and a sprinkle of chia seeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Lunch:</strong> A large salad with grilled salmon, mixed greens, chickpeas, cucumber, tomatoes, and a lemon-tahini dressing.</li>
        <li><strong>Afternoon Snack:</strong> An apple with a tablespoon of almond butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Dinner:</strong> A bowl of lentil soup with a side of roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="foods-to-avoid">Foods to Limit or Avoid</h2>
    <p>Equally important to knowing what to eat is knowing what to avoid to keep your baby safe. Certain foods carry a higher risk of containing harmful bacteria like Listeria and Salmonella, or high levels of toxins like mercury.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>High-Mercury Fish:</strong> Avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish.</li>
      <li><strong>Raw or Undercooked Foods:</strong> This includes raw fish (sushi), undercooked meat, poultry, and eggs (runny yolks). Cook all animal products thoroughly.</li>
      <li><strong>Unpasteurized Dairy and Juices:</strong> Avoid soft cheeses like feta, brie, and queso fresco unless the label clearly states they are made with pasteurized milk.</li>
      <li><strong>Deli Meats and Hot Dogs:</strong> These can be a source of Listeria. If you eat them, ensure they are heated until steaming hot.</li>
      <li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> No amount of alcohol is considered safe during pregnancy. It's best to avoid it completely.</li>
      <li><strong>Excessive Caffeine:</strong> Limit caffeine intake to less than 200 mg per day (about one 12-ounce cup of coffee).</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3 id="action-today">ðŸš€ Take Action Today</h3>
      <p>Building healthy habits starts with one small step. Don't try to overhaul your entire diet overnight. Instead, pick ONE simple action to take today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Add a Superfood:</strong> Choose one of the superfoods from the list above and add it to your grocery list or your next meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrate Smart:</strong> Go fill up a large reusable water bottle and keep it with you for the rest of the day.</li>
        <li><strong>Read a Label:</strong> The next time you're at the store, check the label on a yogurt or cereal box to see if it's fortified with key nutrients.</li>
