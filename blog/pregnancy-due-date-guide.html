    <h1>Your Pregnancy Timeline: A Guide to Calculating Your Due Date</h1>
    <p class="muted">Published on: September 3, 2025</p>
    <p>Finding out you're pregnant is a momentous occasion, and one of the first questions that comes to mind is, "When is the baby due?" Your Estimated Due Date (EDD) is more than just a date; it's a vital piece of information that helps you and your healthcare provider track your baby's development and plan for their arrival. This guide explains how due dates are calculated and what they mean for your pregnancy journey. Let's start by finding yours.</p>
    
    <div style="text-align:center; margin: 2rem 0;">
      <a href="../pregnancy-calculator.html" class="cta-btn">ü§∞ Find Your Estimated Due Date!</a>
    </div>

    <h2>How is a Due Date Calculated? The Methods Explained</h2>
    <p>A full-term pregnancy typically lasts about 40 weeks (280 days) from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP). Even though conception usually happens about two weeks after your LMP, this date is used as the starting point because it's a date most women know for sure.</p>
    <h3>Naegele's Rule</h3>
    <p>The most common method used by our calculator and healthcare professionals is Naegele's rule. The calculation is simple:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Take the first day of your last menstrual period.</li>
      <li>Subtract three months.</li>
      <li>Add seven days.</li>
      <li>Add one year.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example, if your LMP was April 1, 2025, your EDD would be January 8, 2026. This rule assumes a regular 28-day menstrual cycle.</p>
    

    <h2>Is the Due Date a Guarantee?</h2>
    <p>It's important to remember that the EDD is an *estimate*. In fact, only about 5% of babies are born on their actual due date! A normal, full-term delivery can happen anytime between 38 and 42 weeks. The due date is best seen as a midpoint of a "due window" when your baby is likely to arrive. Your first ultrasound is often used to confirm or adjust the due date calculated from your LMP, as it can measure the baby's size to determine a more accurate gestational age.</p>

    <h2>‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>How accurate are online due date calculators?</summary>
      <p>They are very accurate at applying Naegele's rule. If you have a regular 28-day cycle and know the first day of your last period, the calculation will be the same one your doctor initially uses.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What if I have an irregular cycle or don't know my LMP?</summary>
      <p>If your cycles are irregular or you're unsure of your LMP, a due date calculator will be less accurate. In this case, your healthcare provider will rely on an early ultrasound to measure the baby and determine your due date, which is the most accurate method in this scenario.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can an ultrasound change my due date?</summary>
      <p>Yes, and this is very common. An ultrasound performed in the first trimester (especially between 8 and 13 weeks) is the most accurate way to date a pregnancy. If the ultrasound date differs significantly from your LMP-calculated date, your doctor will likely use the ultrasound date as your official EDD.</p>
