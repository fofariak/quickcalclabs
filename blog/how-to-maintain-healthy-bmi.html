    <p>Calculating your Body Mass Index (BMI) is a great first step toward understanding your health. But what comes next? Whether you've recently reached a healthy BMI or have been in the healthy range for a while, the real goal is to maintain it for the long term. This isn't about quick fixes or strict diets; it's about building sustainable, healthy habits that become a natural part of your life. In this guide, we'll explore practical strategies for maintaining a healthy BMI. First, let's make sure you know your current number.</p>

    <h2>1. Embrace a Balanced Diet, Not a Restrictive One</h2>
    <p>The foundation of a healthy weight is a balanced diet. This doesn't mean you have to give up your favorite foods. Instead, focus on the principle of moderation and nutrient density.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fill Up on Whole Foods:</strong> Prioritize fruits, vegetables, lean proteins (chicken, fish, beans), and whole grains (oats, brown rice). These foods are packed with nutrients and fiber, which help you feel full and satisfied.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Portion Control:</strong> Be mindful of serving sizes. Sometimes, simply using a smaller plate can make a big difference without feeling like you're depriving yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can prevent you from mistaking thirst for hunger and supports your overall metabolism.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Make Movement a Consistent Part of Your Week</h2>
    <p>Regular physical activity is crucial for maintaining weight and overall health. The key is consistency, not intensity. Find activities you genuinely enjoy to make exercise a habit you'll stick with.</p>

    <h3>A Mix of Cardio and Strength</h3>
    <p>Aim for a combination of cardiovascular exercise and strength training.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cardio (Aerobic Exercise):</strong> Activities like brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming help burn calories and are excellent for your heart health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio per week.</li>
      <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> Building muscle is one of the best things you can do for your metabolism. Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue. You don't need to be a bodybuilder‚Äîusing resistance bands, dumbbells, or even your own body weight two to three times a week is highly effective.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Prioritize Sleep and Manage Stress</h2>
    <p>Health isn't just about diet and exercise. Sleep and stress play a massive role in weight management.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Get Enough Sleep:</strong> A lack of sleep can disrupt the hormones that regulate hunger (ghrelin and leptin), leading to increased cravings for unhealthy foods. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.</li>
      <li><strong>Find Healthy Ways to De-stress:</strong> Chronic stress elevates cortisol levels, a hormone that can lead to weight gain, especially around the abdomen. Incorporate stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, reading, or spending time in nature into your routine.</li>
    </ul>
