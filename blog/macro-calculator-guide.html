    <p>If you've spent any time in the fitness world, you've heard the term "macros." While calorie counting is the foundation of weight management, understanding macronutrients‚Äîor macros‚Äîis the next level. It's the secret to optimizing your body composition, whether you want to lose fat, build muscle, or fuel your performance. This guide will teach you everything you need to know. First, find out what your personal macro ratio should be.</p>

    <h2>What Are Macronutrients? The Big Three</h2>
    <p>Macronutrients are the nutrients your body needs in large amounts to produce energy and function correctly. There are three of them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Protein (4 calories per gram):</strong> The building block of the body. Essential for building and repairing tissues, including muscle. It's also the most satiating macro, helping you feel full and satisfied.</li>
      <li><strong>Carbohydrates (4 calories per gram):</strong> The body's primary and preferred source of energy. They fuel your brain, kidneys, heart muscles, and central nervous system.</li>
      <li><strong>Fats (9 calories per gram):</strong> Crucial for hormone production, vitamin absorption, and protecting your organs. Healthy fats are a vital part of any diet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tracking macros isn't about eliminating any of these groups; it's about finding the right balance for your specific goals.</p>

    <h2>Why Does Macro Ratio Matter?</h2>
    <p>A calorie is a calorie, but the source of that calorie tells your body what to do with it. For example, a diet high in protein while in a calorie deficit helps preserve muscle mass, ensuring you're primarily losing fat. A diet with adequate carbohydrates will fuel intense workouts, while sufficient fat intake keeps your hormones in check. By adjusting your macro ratio, you can fine-tune your body's response to your diet and training.</p>

    <h2>‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>What's the difference between tracking macros and tracking calories?</summary>
      <p>Tracking calories only looks at the total energy intake. Tracking macros looks at where that energy comes from (protein, carbs, or fat). While a calorie deficit is needed for weight loss, the macro ratio determines the quality of that weight loss (i.e., losing fat vs. muscle).</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Is a low-carb diet the best for weight loss?</summary>
      <p>Not necessarily. While low-carb diets can be effective for some people, they aren't superior for fat loss when calories and protein are matched. The best diet is one you can stick to consistently that meets your protein needs and fuels your lifestyle.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How often should I recalculate my macros?</summary>
      <p>It's a good idea to recalculate your macros after every 10-15 lbs of weight loss or gain, or if your activity level changes significantly. This ensures your targets remain aligned with your body's current needs.</p>
