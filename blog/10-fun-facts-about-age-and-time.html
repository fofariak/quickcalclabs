    <p>Age and time are concepts so fundamental to our lives that we often take them for granted. But when you look closer, they are filled with fascinating quirks, cultural differences, and mind-bending science. From the way our brains perceive time to the strange realities of space travel, get ready to see age in a whole new light. And if you want to know your own age down to the second, we can help with that!</p>

    <h2>1. You're Older on a Mountaintop</h2>
    <p>Thanks to Einstein's theory of relativity, we know that time moves slower where gravity is stronger. This means that time passes slightly faster at the top of a mountain than it does at sea level. The difference is minuscule‚Äînanoseconds over a lifetime‚Äîbut it's real! Your head is technically aging faster than your feet.</p>

    <h2>2. A "Year" Isn't the Same on Other Planets</h2>
    <p>We measure our age in Earth years, but if you lived on another planet, your age would be wildly different. A year on Mercury is just 88 Earth days, so you'd be celebrating birthdays constantly. A year on Jupiter, however, is nearly 12 Earth years, meaning you'd have to wait a long time to turn "1"!</p>
    

    <h2>3. Babies Are 1 Year Old at Birth in Some Cultures</h2>
    <p>In many East Asian cultures, including Korea, a baby is considered one year old the day they are born. This is called East Asian age reckoning. They also get a year older every Lunar New Year, not on their birthday. So, a baby born in December could be two years old just a few weeks after birth!</p>

    <h2>4. There's No "24 Hours" in a Day</h2>
    <p>We say a day is 24 hours long, but the Earth actually takes 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds to complete one full rotation. Our 24-hour day is based on the time it takes for the sun to return to the same position in the sky, not a perfect spin.</p>

    <h2>5. "Leap Seconds" Keep Our Clocks in Sync</h2>
    <p>Because the Earth's rotation is gradually slowing down, our super-accurate atomic clocks get out of sync with the planet. To fix this, scientists occasionally add a "leap second" to the official world time (UTC), usually on June 30 or December 31.</p>

    <h2>6. Time Feels Faster as You Get Older</h2>
    <p>It's not just your imagination. Psychologists believe this happens because, for a 10-year-old, one year is 10% of their entire life. For a 50-year-old, one year is only 2% of their life. New and novel experiences also make time feel slower, and adults tend to have fewer of them than children.</p>

    <h2>7. The "Birthday Paradox"</h2>
    <p>In a group of just 23 people, there is a 50% chance that two of them share the same birthday. In a group of 75 people, the probability jumps to 99.9%! It's a fascinating statistical quirk.</p>
    
    <h2>8. You Were Once the Youngest Person in the Universe</h2>
    <p>For a brief, infinitesimally small moment after your birth, you held the title of the youngest person in existence. </p>

    <h2>9. The Term "Teenager" is Surprisingly New</h2>
    <p>The word "teenager" didn't become common until the 1940s. Before that, you were simply a child, and then you were a young adult. The concept of a distinct "teenage" life stage is a modern invention.</p>
    
    <h2>10. A Calendar Month Is Not Based on Anything Astronomical</h2>
    <p>A day is based on the Earth's rotation, and a year is based on its orbit around the sun. But a month? The 28, 30, or 31 days in our calendar months are mostly a historical and political construct, loosely based on the lunar cycle but not perfectly aligned with it.</p>
