    <p>Pregnancy is a remarkable 40-week journey that is typically divided into three stages, or trimesters. Each trimester brings its own unique set of changes, milestones, and challenges for both you and your growing baby. Understanding what to expect during each phase can help you feel more prepared, confident, and in tune with your body. This guide provides a simple overview of the three trimesters. Start your journey by finding out your estimated due date!</p>

    <h2>The First Trimester (Weeks 1-13)</h2>
    <p>This is a time of rapid development, even though you may not "look" pregnant yet. Your body is working incredibly hard to build the foundation for your baby.</p>
    <h3>What's Happening with Your Baby?</h3>
    <p>By the end of the first trimester, all of your baby's major organs and body systems have been formed. Their heart is beating, and they are starting to develop tiny fingers and toes. They are about the size of a lemon.</p>
    <h3>Common Symptoms for Mom:</h3>
    <p>This trimester is famous for its challenging symptoms as your hormones surge. You might experience fatigue, morning sickness (which can happen any time of day), tender breasts, and frequent urination.</p>

    <h2>The Second Trimester (Weeks 14-27)</h2>
    <p>Often called the "honeymoon" phase of pregnancy, the second trimester is when many women start to feel their best. The early discomforts often fade, and your energy levels may return.</p>
    <h3>What's Happening with Your Baby?</h3>
    <p>Your baby continues to grow and mature. You will likely start to feel their first little movements, known as "quickening." They can now hear sounds from outside the womb. By the end of this trimester, your baby is about the size of a head of cauliflower.</p>
    <h3>Common Symptoms for Mom:</h3>
    <p>You'll notice your baby bump growing more noticeably. You might experience backaches as your center of gravity shifts, and your skin may change (some women get a dark line on their abdomen called the linea nigra).</p>
    

    <h2>The Third Trimester (Weeks 28-40)</h2>
    <p>You're on the home stretch! Your baby is now focused on gaining weight and getting ready for birth.</p>
    <h3>What's Happening with Your Baby?</h3>
    <p>Your baby's lungs are maturing, and they are practicing breathing movements. They will typically settle into a head-down position to prepare for delivery. They are growing rapidly and will be about the size of a small pumpkin by your due date.</p>
    <h3>Common Symptoms for Mom:</h3>
    <p>Discomfort is common as your baby gets bigger. You might experience shortness of breath, heartburn, swelling in your feet and ankles, and difficulty sleeping. You'll also likely feel Braxton Hicks contractions, which are "practice" contractions that are not a sign of labor.</p>
