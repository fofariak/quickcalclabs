    <p>Pregnancy is a remarkable 40-week journey that is typically divided into three stages, or trimesters. Each trimester brings its own unique set of changes, milestones, and challenges for both you and your growing baby. Understanding what to expect during each phase can help you feel more prepared, confident, and in tune with your body. This guide provides a simple overview of the three trimesters. Start your journey by finding out your estimated due date!</p>

    <h2 id="first-trimester">The First Trimester (Weeks 1-13)</h2>
    <p>This is a time of rapid and fundamental development, even though you may not "look" pregnant yet. Your body is working incredibly hard to build the foundation for your baby.</p>
    <h3>What's Happening with Your Baby?</h3>
    <p>From a single fertilized cell, your baby grows into a fully-formed fetus. By the end of the first trimester, all of your baby's major organs and body systems have been formed. Their heart is beating, and they are starting to develop tiny fingers, toes, and facial features. They are about the size of a lemon.</p>
    <h3>Common Symptoms for Mom:</h3>
    <p>This trimester is famous for its challenging symptoms as your hormones, particularly hCG and progesterone, surge. You might experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Your body is using a tremendous amount of energy to build the placenta and support the baby's growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Morning Sickness:</strong> Nausea and vomiting can happen any time of day and are very common.</li>
      <li><strong>Tender Breasts:</strong> Your breasts may feel sore and swollen as they prepare for breastfeeding.</li>
      <li><strong>Frequent Urination:</strong> Your growing uterus puts pressure on your bladder.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="second-trimester">The Second Trimester (Weeks 14-27)</h2>
    <p>Often called the "honeymoon" phase of pregnancy, the second trimester is when many women start to feel their best. The early discomforts often fade, and your energy levels may return as the placenta takes over hormone production.</p>
    <h3>What's Happening with Your Baby?</h3>
    <p>Your baby continues to grow and mature rapidly. You will likely start to feel their first little movements, known as "quickening," which can feel like flutters. They can now hear sounds from outside the womb, and their sleep and wake cycles become more regular. By the end of this trimester, your baby is about the size of a head of cauliflower.</p>
    <h3>Common Symptoms for Mom:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Growing Bump:</strong> Your baby bump will become more noticeable.</li>
      <li><strong>Backaches:</strong> As your center of gravity shifts, you might experience aches and pains.</li>
      <li><strong>Skin Changes:</strong> Some women get a dark line on their abdomen called the linea nigra or patches of darker skin on their face.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="info-box">
      <p><strong>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</strong> The second trimester is a great time to focus on gentle exercise like prenatal yoga or swimming. It's also a good time to start planning for the baby's arrival, as you'll likely have more energy than in the first or third trimesters.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="third-trimester">The Third Trimester (Weeks 28-40)</h2>
    <p>You're on the home stretch! Your baby is now focused on gaining weight and getting ready for birth. This trimester is a time of anticipation and preparation.</p>
    <h3>What's Happening with Your Baby?</h3>
    <p>Your baby's lungs are maturing, and they are practicing breathing movements. They will typically settle into a head-down position to prepare for delivery. They are growing rapidly, gaining about half a pound a week, and will be about the size of a small pumpkin by your due date.</p>
    <h3>Common Symptoms for Mom:</h3>
    <p>Discomfort is common as your baby gets bigger and takes up more space.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shortness of Breath:</strong> Your growing uterus can press up against your diaphragm.</li>
      <li><strong>Heartburn:</strong> The uterus can also press on your stomach, causing acid reflux.</li>
      - <strong>Swelling:</strong> You might notice swelling in your feet and ankles.
      - <strong>Braxton Hicks Contractions:</strong> These are "practice" contractions that are irregular and not a sign of labor. They feel like a tightening of the abdomen.
    </ul>
