    <h1>Body Fat Percentage vs. BMI: Which Is a Better Indicator of Health?</h1>

    <p>When it comes to measuring health, two of the most common terms you'll hear are BMI and Body Fat Percentage. Both are used to assess whether your weight is healthy, but they measure very different things. While BMI is a quick and easy calculation, Body Fat Percentage gives you a much clearer picture of your actual body composition. So, which one should you pay more attention to? This guide will break down the differences to help you understand what really matters for your health. Let's start by calculating your body fat.</p>

    <div style="text-align:center; margin: 2rem 0;"><a href="../body-fat-calculator.html" class="cta-btn">ðŸ’ª Calculate Your Body Fat Percentage</a></div>

    <h2>What is BMI? A Quick Refresher</h2>
    <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple formula that uses your height and weight to give you a score. This score then places you in a category: underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. It's a useful screening tool for the general population because it's so easy to calculate.</p>
    <h3>The Major Flaw of BMI</h3>
    <p>The biggest problem with BMI is that it **cannot tell the difference between fat and muscle**. A pound of muscle takes up less space than a pound of fat but weighs the same. This means that a very muscular person, like an athlete or a weightlifter, could have a high BMI that classifies them as "overweight," even though they are incredibly fit and healthy.</p>

    <h2>What is Body Fat Percentage?</h2>
    <p>Body Fat Percentage is exactly what it sounds like: it's the percentage of your total weight that is made up of fat. The rest of your weight is what's called "lean body mass," which includes muscle, bones, organs, and water.</p>
    <h3>Why Body Fat Percentage is More Accurate</h3>
    <p>This measurement gives you a much better understanding of your health because it looks at your **body composition**. High body fat is linked to an increased risk of health problems like heart disease and diabetes, regardless of what the scale says. A person can be "thin-fat" (also known as normal weight obesity), meaning they have a normal BMI but a high body fat percentage, which still puts them at risk.</p>
    

    <h2>The Verdict: Which is Better?</h2>
    <p>For most people, **Body Fat Percentage is a more meaningful and accurate indicator of health than BMI.** It gives you a real look at your body's makeup of fat versus lean tissue, which is what truly impacts your health risks.</p>
    <p>However, that doesn't mean BMI is useless. It's still a valuable, quick screening tool. The best approach is to use both. If your BMI is high, the next logical step is to determine your body fat percentage to get the full story. If both your BMI and body fat percentage are high, it's a clear sign that it's time to make some healthy lifestyle changes.</p>
