        <h2>How to Use This Age Calculator</h2>
        <p>Finding out your precise age has never been easier. Just follow these two simple steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Select Your Date of Birth:</strong> Click on the input field and use the calendar to select the month, day, and year you were born.</li>
            <li><strong>Click Calculate:</strong> Hit the "Calculate My Age" button. Your detailed results will instantly appear below.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Understanding Chronological Age</h2>
        <p>This tool calculates your <strong>chronological age</strong>, which is the most common way to express age. It is simply the amount of time that has passed from the moment you were born until today. This is different from biological age, which relates to how old your body seems based on various health markers.</p>
        <p>Our calculator performs a precise date subtraction, accounting for all the complexities like varying numbers of days in months and leap years, to give you an exact result in years, months, and days.</p>
        
        <h2>Practical Uses for an Age Calculator</h2>
        <p>While it's fun to find out your age down to the day, an age calculator has many practical applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Official Forms:</strong> Accurately filling out government documents, insurance applications, or legal paperwork that requires your precise age.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Eligibility:</strong> Determining if someone meets the age requirements for school enrollment, sports leagues, marathons, or job applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Milestone Tracking:</strong> Calculating the time until important age milestones, such as obtaining a driver's license, voting age, or retirement eligibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Health and Wellness:</strong> Tracking a child's age in months for developmental checkups or calculating age for fitness and medical assessments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Does the Calculation Work?</h2>
        <p>Calculating age isn't as simple as just subtracting years. Our calculator's logic follows a precise method:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>It starts by subtracting the birth year from the current year.</li>
            <li>Next, it subtracts the birth month from the current month. If the result is negative, it subtracts one year from the total and adds 12 to the months.</li>
            <li>Finally, it subtracts the birth day from the current day. If that result is negative, it subtracts one month from the total and adds the number of days in the previous month to the day count.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This careful process, which also factors in leap years, ensures you get a completely accurate result every time.</p>

    <h2>‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Is this calculator completely accurate?</summary>
      <p>‚úÖ Yes. Our calculator accounts for leap years and the varying number of days in each month to provide your precise chronological age as of today's date.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can I calculate the age of a historical figure?</summary>
      <p>‚úîÔ∏è Absolutely! As long as you know their date of birth, you can enter it to find out how old they would be today, or calculate their age at the time of their death by setting the "age at date" to their death date (a feature in more advanced calculators).</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Why is my calculated age different from just subtracting years?</summary>
      <p>üì§ Simply subtracting the birth year from the current year doesn't account for whether you've had your birthday yet this year. Our tool calculates the full passage of time, including months and days, for a more accurate result.</p>
