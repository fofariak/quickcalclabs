        <summary>How baby name numerology is calculated</summary>
        <p>We use the classic <strong>Pythagorean numerology</strong> system:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each letter A–Z is assigned a value from 1–9.</li>
          <li>We add the values for all letters in the name, then keep reducing by adding the digits of the total until we get a single digit (1–9) or a master number (11 or 22).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The result is mapped to common numerology interpretations (for example, 1 = leadership, 2 = harmony, 3 = creativity). This is a <strong>spiritual / symbolic tool, not a scientific one</strong>, and should be used playfully alongside other ways of choosing a name.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Baby Name Numerology</h2>
      <p>Numerology is an ancient metaphysical practice that assigns meaning to numbers derived from letters in names. Many parents find it adds a layer of <strong>spiritual significance and intentionality</strong> to the already meaningful process of choosing a baby name.</p>
      
      <p>While numerology is not science-based, it can serve as a thoughtful framework for considering the qualities and values you hope to nurture in your child—a way to add purposeful meaning to a name you already love.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>🔢 How Pythagorean Numerology Works</h4>
        <p>Each letter A-Z is assigned a number 1-9. We add all letter values in the name, then reduce the total by adding its digits together until we reach a single digit (1-9) or a master number (11 or 22).</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Example:</strong> AVA → A(1) + V(4) + A(1) = 6 → Name Number is 6 (The Nurturer)</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Meaning of Each Name Number</h2>
      <p>Here's a complete guide to the traditional meanings associated with each numerology number:</p>

      <h3>1 – The Leader</h3>
      <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Independence, ambition, initiative, originality, pioneering spirit</p>
      <p>Names that reduce to 1 are associated with natural leadership, self-reliance, and the courage to forge new paths. These individuals often become innovators and trailblazers. Potential challenges include learning to collaborate and considering others' perspectives.</p>

      <h3>2 – The Peacemaker</h3>
      <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Cooperation, sensitivity, harmony, diplomacy, intuition</p>
      <p>Number 2 names suggest a gentle, empathetic nature with strong relationship skills. These individuals often excel at mediation and creating harmony. They tend to be supportive partners and friends. Challenges may include building confidence and avoiding over-accommodation.</p>

      <h3>3 – The Creator</h3>
      <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Creativity, self-expression, joy, communication, optimism</p>
      <p>Three is the number of creative expression and social connection. These names suggest artistic ability, verbal skills, and an infectious enthusiasm for life. Potential challenges include focus and follow-through on long-term projects.</p>

      <h3>4 – The Builder</h3>
      <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Stability, practicality, reliability, hard work, organization</p>
      <p>Four represents solid foundations and methodical progress. Names with this number suggest dependability, strong work ethic, and the ability to create lasting structures. Challenges may include flexibility and embracing change.</p>

      <h3>5 – The Explorer</h3>
      <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Freedom, adaptability, curiosity, adventure, versatility</p>
      <p>Five is the number of change and experience. These names suggest a love of adventure, quick thinking, and the ability to thrive in varied situations. Potential challenges include commitment and restlessness.</p>

      <h3>6 – The Nurturer</h3>
      <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Love, responsibility, care, family, service, harmony</p>
      <p>Six represents the heart of home and family. Names with this number suggest natural caregiving abilities, strong sense of responsibility, and desire to create beauty and comfort. Challenges may include setting boundaries and avoiding over-responsibility.</p>

      <h3>7 – The Seeker</h3>
      <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Wisdom, intuition, depth, analysis, spirituality</p>
      <p>Seven is the most introspective number. These names suggest a philosophical mind, love of learning, and natural intuition. Potential challenges include isolation and overthinking.</p>

      <h3>8 – The Achiever</h3>
      <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Success, strength, abundance, authority, manifestation</p>
      <p>Eight represents material and professional success. Names with this number suggest ambition, strong organizational skills, and the ability to achieve goals. Challenges may include balancing material success with other life areas.</p>

      <h3>9 – The Humanitarian</h3>
      <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Compassion, idealism, generosity, global awareness, wisdom</p>
      <p>Nine represents completion and universal love. These names suggest a broad worldview, desire to help others, and natural teaching abilities. Potential challenges include learning to let go and avoiding martyr tendencies.</p>

      <h3>11 – Master Intuitive</h3>
      <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Inspiration, insight, sensitivity, spiritual awareness, illumination</p>
      <p>Eleven is a master number combining the leadership of 1 with heightened intuition and spiritual awareness. These names suggest exceptional intuitive gifts and the potential to inspire others. Challenges include managing sensitivity and anxiety.</p>

      <h3>22 – Master Builder</h3>
      <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Vision, practicality, impact, large-scale achievement, legacy</p>
      <p>Twenty-two combines visionary thinking with practical ability—the potential to turn grand dreams into reality. These names suggest the ability to create lasting impact. Challenges include handling the pressure of high potential.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>✨ Using Numerology Thoughtfully</h4>
        <p>Numerology is best used as <strong>one of many inputs</strong> in choosing a baby name—not as the deciding factor. Consider:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <li>Does the name honor family, culture, or tradition?</li>
          <li>How does it sound with your last name?</li>
          <li>What are the initials?</li>
          <li>Are there any unwanted nickname possibilities?</li>
          <li>Does it feel right for your child?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>The Pythagorean Number Chart</h2>
      <p>Here's the letter-to-number conversion used in Pythagorean numerology:</p>
      
      <div style="font-family: monospace; background: rgba(139,92,246,0.08); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center;">
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>1:</strong> A, J, S</p>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>2:</strong> B, K, T</p>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>3:</strong> C, L, U</p>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>4:</strong> D, M, V</p>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>5:</strong> E, N, W</p>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>6:</strong> F, O, X</p>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>7:</strong> G, P, Y</p>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>8:</strong> H, Q, Z</p>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;"><strong>9:</strong> I, R</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Other Numerology Systems</h2>
      <p>While this calculator uses the popular Pythagorean system, other numerology traditions exist:</p>

      <h3>Chaldean Numerology</h3>
      <p>An older system that uses different letter-to-number assignments and doesn't use the number 9 in calculations. Some practitioners consider it more accurate but it's less commonly used.</p>

      <h3>Kabbalah Numerology</h3>
      <p>Based on Hebrew letters and their mystical meanings. Uses 22 vibrations corresponding to the Hebrew alphabet.</p>

      <h3>Chinese Numerology</h3>
      <p>Based on sound-alike words. For example, 8 sounds like "prosperity" in Cantonese, making it lucky. 4 sounds like "death," making it unlucky.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Name Numerology</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Does numerology really predict personality?</summary>
      <p>Numerology is considered a metaphysical or spiritual practice, not a science. There's no scientific evidence that name numbers predict personality or destiny. Use the meanings as inspiration and a framework for thinking about values you hope to nurture—not as fixed destiny or scientific prediction.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Should I change a name based on the number?</summary>
      <p>Names carry family meaning, cultural significance, sound, and personal connection. Numerology can be one fun input among many—not the final decision maker. If you love a name for its meaning, sound, or family significance, that matters more than its numerology number.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Should I use first name, middle name, or full name?</summary>
      <p>Different practitioners have different views. Some calculate only the first name (the "personality number"), some use the full name at birth (the "destiny number"), and some look at what the child will be called most often. Try calculating different combinations and see what resonates with you.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What about nicknames?</summary>
      <p>Some numerologists believe the name used most often carries the strongest vibration. If your child will primarily go by a nickname (like "Kate" instead of "Katherine"), you might want to check that name's number as well.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Are master numbers (11, 22) better than single digits?</summary>
      <p>Master numbers aren't "better"—they're different. They carry higher potential but also more intense challenges. Some numerologists view them as having both the master number energy and the reduced single digit (11 = 2, 22 = 4) as options for the person to express.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can two children have the same number but different personalities?</summary>
      <p>Absolutely. In numerology theory, the number represents potential and tendencies, not fixed traits. How someone expresses their number depends on many factors. And of course, personality is shaped by genetics, environment, experiences, and individual choices—not name numbers.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Why does Pythagorean numerology use 1-9?</summary>
      <p>Pythagorean numerology is based on the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras's teachings about numbers. He believed numbers 1-9 contained all basic energies, and larger numbers were simply combinations of these fundamental vibrations. Master numbers 11 and 22 are exceptions considered too powerful to reduce.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Is Chaldean or Pythagorean numerology better?</summary>
      <p>This is debated among practitioners. Chaldean is older (from ancient Babylon) and some consider it more accurate. Pythagorean is more widely used and easier to calculate. Neither has scientific validation, so choose whichever resonates with you or try both and compare.</p>
